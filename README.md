# Project Info [Eng]

The city of Ghent is setting up a traffic control center and is looking for a tool that warns inhabitants and people on the move when something unexpected happens regarding mobility in their neighbourhood or on their daily commute. Features:
- get info from Waze, train operator, bus operator, roadworks, ..
- let users make a profile with (if they want): location of their home, work, routes, when en how they travel
- match mobility events with the user profiles
- inform users through social media if something could potentially influence their journey (roadworks, train / bus delay, accident, traffic jam, ..) 
- if possible, collect feedback from users
